yUML-to-Code
============
[yUML.me] (http://yuml.me/) is nice a web tool to draw simple UML diagrams. You define your UML diagram with a straightforward text language, and yUML.me converts it to a png file. This program generates Java Code from -almost- the same language.

You can have your diagrams drawn with yUML.me and your Java code stub generated with yUML-to-Code.

yUML-to-Code input
------------------
The input language in yUML-to-Code is a restricted version of the language used at yUML.me. Not all valid input at yUML.me will work with this program, but all valid input with yUML-to-Code will work at yUML.me.

### Lenguaje details and examples
Please download the [Cheat List] (https://github.com/downloads/salvadorjesus/yUML-to-code/UML%20to%20code%20cheat%20list%20and%20exaples.pdf) -click on the big "Downloads" button- to learn how to write UML diagrams with yUML-to-Code properly.
If you have already tried yUML.me, you will find that the yUML-to-Code language is trickier. Just read the examples, and you will soon learn all the gotchats.
Also, you can do things that you cannot do at yUML.me, like defining a class in several parts.

About this program
------------------
This program is a small school project to learn [Antlr](http://www.antlr.org/). I chose this topic to feel that I was doing something useful, while having fun sharing the code.

If you liked it, please let me know!

If you disliked it because you found a bug, or you wish it to have another feature, please [fill in an issue] (https://github.com/salvadorjesus/yUML-to-code/issues). I don't plan to maintain this program or to make further development, but if I see some interest, I may well change my mind!

Finally, if you hate it, I can only say that I will try harder next time! ;). Check out some of my [pics](https://profiles.google.com/salvadorjesus/photos/5481492753093488689)!

I don't personally know or work with the creators and owners of yUML.me in any way. This is an original work, and in no way related with the software or people at yUML.me.

I just happen to like this web tool!
